List cutest mammals

The reason why we are so attracted by baby animals is attributable to
their physical characteristics and our species' instinct for parental care.
It is a universal fact: we find baby animals more cute and pleasing
to look at than to the grown up version. They win over us with their disproportionate
bodys, like big eyes, short legs or wings and tiny heads.
